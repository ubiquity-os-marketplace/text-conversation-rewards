        "content": "I think the most pure architecture would be that plugins can NOT inherit (write) authentication (only read if possible) of the kernel. As a consequence, no plugin should be able to post directly any issue. Ideally it should only be the kernel with a direct interface to issues. Plugins should just output comment HTML and the kernel can post it all in a single comment at the end of the webhook event invocation chain.\r\nCould be interesting to have a dedicated plugin to handle commenting, but because this seems like such an essential capability, I would more carefully consider the pros/cons of including this within the kernel. \r\n- On one hand, I really like the idea of making the kernel as pure and lean as possible\r\n- On the other hand there are practical considerations that if every plugin standard output interface includes `comment:` and then we don't have the `comment` capability available (the comment plugin is not included in the config) then why is this a standard output property required on every plugin?\r\nI'm not concerned about latency now. Besides we can port any plugin to Cloudflare Workers (or combine several inside a single Worker) when we are ready to fix latency issues. To be honest though, except for setting labels, I have no problem with latency (like with permit generation) so there's no need to overengineer yet. I also love the GitHub Actions logs being available for easy debugging, and the fact that they are super generous with the compute. \r\nGiven the entire conversation and all the considerations, I definitely think we should do option 3. \r\nThis separates concerns the best, which will allow our plugin ecosystem to grow the fastest.",

For simple plugin configurations (plugins not modifying the output results of others) this seems like straightforward architecture. \r\nHowever, as we know, there will be situations where a subsequent plugin will consider the results of a previous plugin, which means it would need to change the comment that is rendered. \r\nIn this situation the subsequent plugin should clobber the output of the previous plugin. It is now clear to be that this will be a new challenge to express to the kernel that it should ignore the comment output of a previous plugin.

In such case the kernel should pass down results. It is more of an architecture question.

Should the Kernel send the rendering it wants, should the comment plugin transform the data to HTML?\r\nThen, comment-reward wants to post the results. Should ask the Kernel to call the comment plugin, but then formatting is different. Should the Kernel notify the comment plugin that it wants a different output formatting? Should the Kernel compute beforehand the HTML and send it to the comment plugin?\r\nMight be something I don't grasp there.
