    "body": "I've implemented the basic content evaluation functionality. The algorithm analyzes comments and assigns relevance scores between 0 and 1 based on their technical content and how well they address the issue requirements. Here's a sample of how it works:\n\n```typescript\nasync _evaluateComments(specificationBody: string, comments: Comment[], allComments: Comment[], prComments: Comment[]): Promise<{ [id: string]: number }> {\n  const relevance: { [id: string]: number } = {};\n  \n  // Process each comment and calculate relevance\n  for (const comment of [...comments, ...prComments]) {\n    const score = await this._calculateRelevanceScore(specificationBody, comment.body);\n    relevance[`${comment.id}`] = score;\n  }\n  \n  return relevance;\n}\n```\n\nWhat do you think of this implementation?",
